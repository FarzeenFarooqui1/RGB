# RGB
Purpose: To find RGB values of multiple images and plot the RGB values using Plotly in python

Instructions:

1. A video is saved into the "Data" folder. The "Frames" function is then run which divides the video into frames at a rate of 1 frames per second.
2. The "Test" function will then find all the created frames in the "Data" folder but only look at the ones that are image files. It will then print out the RGB values of every frame in an organized list of Numpy arrays.
3. The list is then converted into a variable that can be used throughout the program. 
4. The functions "new_R", "new_G", "new_B" will then take the indiviual columns of the numpy array and store them as variables.
5. The 2D arrays are then all flattened into more workable 1D arrays.
6. The "Graph_R",Graph_G", Graph_B" functions will then return a bar graph of the RGB values of every image.
